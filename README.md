# ECE250 Testcases

This repository contains a collection of MIT-licensed testcases for each project in ECE250.

# Sweet, but how do I use them

As recommended ime and time again by the teaching staff, it is highly recommended you do your testing from an eceubuntu server.
Steps to connect to such a server is beyond the scope of this README.

Once you're logged into an eceubuntu server (or a local Unix/Linux system of your own), clone this repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JZJisawesome/ece250-testcases
